# Python Project - Life Expectancy Analysis
In this data portfolio project, utilizing World Bank data, I conducted a comprehensive regression analysis aimed at discerning the primary determinants of life expectancy.

**Guiding research Questions**

 What are the key socio-economic indicators available in the dataset, and how do they vary across different countries and over time?
 
•   Which variables show the strongest correlation with life expectancy?

•   How does life expectancy vary across countries?

•   What is the trend in life expectancy over the two-decade period covered by the dataset, and are there any notable changes or patterns?

•   How do socio-economic factors such as GDP per capita, health expenditure, and access to basic services (e.g., clean water, electricity) influence life expectancy? 

•   Do countries which are geographically close to each other have similar life expectancies?  

**Data**

The dataset "Life Expectancy 2000-2020" was obtained from Kaggle and originates from the World Bank. It provides comprehensive information on various socio-economic indicators for different countries from 2000 to 2020. The dataset includes data on life expectancy, population, CO2 emissions, health expenditure, GDP per capita, internet usage, and more. 
It can be found here: [https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/raminrzayev/life-expectancy-2000-2020 ]

I analysed the Data using Python.
